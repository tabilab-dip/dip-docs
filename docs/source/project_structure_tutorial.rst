Project Structure Tutorial
==========================

This section describes how should your project structure look like.

Let's consider your project's root directory with path "./"
In that root folder you should have a folder named "dip_specs/"

And inside dip_specs you should have the following files:

* author_specs.json
* form_data.json
* root.json

The details for form_data.json and root.json are given in :ref:`form schema tutorial <form-schema-tutorial>`.

The details for author_specs.json are given in :ref:`author specification tutorial <author-spec-tutorial>`.
